## Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA)  

DORA natively employs the most performant consensus algorithm in to the oracle space, and aggregates representative price data (S-value) for a wide array of assets and commodities. To do this, the protocol validates and reports prices derived from up to 21 data sources with Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithms.  Employing a unique Tribe-Clan architecture, DORA is further strengthened and safeguarded by anti-collusion randomness algos (via our decentralised Verifiable Random Function, or dVRF) to ensure the decentralisation qualities of the network persist over time. Likewise, Supra deploys multiple fault-tolerant techniques during the data collection, aggregation, and computation stages to ensure the highest fidelity price feeds and detect abnormal behaviors before they could affect outcomes.
